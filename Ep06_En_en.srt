Dragon's voice:

<i>In a land of myth</i>

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,000
<i>and a time of magic,</i>

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,080
<i>the destiny</i>

5
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,080
<i>of a great kingdom</i>

6
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,040

7
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,040
<i>of a young man.</i>

8
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,680
<i>His name: Merlin.</i>

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,400
Even after

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,400
all these years,

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,440
I still miss him.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,640
He was a good father.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,760
I'm glad we came.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
So am I.

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,320
I think you'd

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,320
be proud.

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,320
Particularly of elyan.

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,840
Me?

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,080
Not just because

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,080
you're a knight,

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,440
but because of

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,440
the man you've become.

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,160
- I don't think so.

24
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,160
- She's right.

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,480
Absolutely.

26
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,240
You're outstanding.

27
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,600
Especially when it comes

28
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,600
to trying to sweet-talk

29
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,600
the ladies,

30
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,000
if nothing else.

31
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,640
Don't listen to him.

32
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,560
No, elyan loves

33
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,560
only one woman.

34
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,240
- Who?

35
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,240
- You.

36
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,000
Tell me

37
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm your sister.

38
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,240
Did Arthur not say?

39
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,720
Arthur never

40
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,720
tells me anything.

41
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,720
But he told you

42
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,720
who gwain's in love with.

43
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,760
- Himself.

44
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,760

48
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,040
They're after

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,040
the queen.

50
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,560

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,040
Sleep, my lady.

54
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,400
For it could be some time

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,400
before you do so again.

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,520
<i>(Theme music playing)</i>

57
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,480
Merlin, hollyhock.

58
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,760
One dram?

59
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,640
And dianthus,

60
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,640
two drams.

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,160
<i>- Three grains.</i>

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,440
What happened?

64
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,840
We were riding.

65
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,400
We came upon

66
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,400
a nest of snakes.

67
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,640
Where's Guinevere?

68
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,480
Where is she?

69
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,600
I told her to get away.

70
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,680
She fled.

71
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,160
- Arthur!

72
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,160
- We ride at dawn.

73
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,840
Gaius:<i> This is no accident.</i>

74
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,080
Merlin:<i> Sorcery.</i>

75
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,280
Gaius:<i> There is dark magic</i>

76

<i>coursing through their veins.</i>

77
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,240
By any right

78
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,240
they should be dead.

79
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
They were lucky.

80
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,040
I fear there's

81
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,040
more to it than luck.

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,360
Sorry, sire.

86
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,440
I wanted you to know

87
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,440
that Leon and percival

88
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,440
are safe.

That's good news.

92
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,080
<i>Arthur,</i>

93
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,160
there is evidence

94
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,160
of sorcery.

95
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,560
Gaius suspects

96
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,560
morgana is involved.

97
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,040
You can go, Merlin.

98
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,800
I lost Guinevere

99
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,800
once before.

100
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,440
You're not going

101
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,440
to lose her.

102
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,640
You're not.

103
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,840
We will find her.

104
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
I swear.

105
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,040
We'll bring her home.

106
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,640
Good morning,

107
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,640
my lady.

108
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,800
What do you

109
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,800
want with me?

110
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,040
I thought we could

111
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,040
play a little game.

112
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,440
A game?

113
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,600
To find out just

114
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,600
how much Arthur

115
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,600
loves you.

116
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,400
It won't work.

117
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,640
You underestimate

118
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,640
his feelings.

119
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,720
He's not stupid.

120
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,440
We'll see.

121
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,200
He'll know you've taken me.

122
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,200
He'll know it's a trap.

123
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,560
He will.

124
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,680
But he'll still come.

125
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,240
She must have been

126
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,240
knocked from her mount

127
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,240
with some force.

128
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,440
Here! Tracks.

129
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,760
They were heading east.

130
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
Let's go.

131
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
(Panting)

132
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,800
Here.

133
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,200
Is it too good for you

134
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,200
now that you're queen?

135
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,120
I don't want

136
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,120
anything from you.

137
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,200
Just my crown.

138
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,320
Drink it.

139
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,000
You may need it.

140
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,320
Why?

141
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,160
I wouldn't be in

142
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,160
such a hurry to know.

143
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,800
(Groans)

144
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,160
It's getting too dark.

145
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,520
We'll keep heading east.

146
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,760
We've lost the trail.

147
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,960
Then we'll

148
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,960
retrace the tracks.

149
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,640
Arthur.

150
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
I'll talk to him.

151
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,000
Sire?

152
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,240
She can't be far.

153
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,480
I know.

154
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,160
But we have to

155
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,160
work together.

156
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,160
We'll make camp

157
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,160
and get a fire

158
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,160
going.

159
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,240
In the morning,

160
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,240
we'll pick up

161
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,240
her trail again.

162
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
Come on.

163
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,840
Keep moving.

164
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,480
Where are

165
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,480
you taking me?

166
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,160
You'll find out.

167
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,240
What is this place?

168
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,320
Sleep well.

169
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,800

with her...

175
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,440
You saved percival.

176

You saved Leon.

177
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,960
But not my own

sister.

179
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,600

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,920
She raised me.

182
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,640
You wouldn't

183
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,640
understand.

184
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,200
I do.

185
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,240
I don't know...

186
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,920
What I'd be if

187
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,920
it wasn't for her.

188
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,640
Can't explain.

189
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,240
You don't have to.

190
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,760
(Screams)

191
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,160
It's all right.

192
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,240
The tower.

193
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,640
It was a dream.

194
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,360
Everything in

195
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,360
its shadow is dead

196
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,240
and the sound,

197
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,240
it was like...

198
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,640
Like children screaming.

199
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,640
And the rain that fell

200
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,640
was like blood.

201
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,080
I had the same dream.

202
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,240
I was lost in a forest.

203
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,480
And the trees had claws,

204
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,880
and I finally

205
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,880
escaped it.

206
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
There was a plain.

207
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,600
Empty as far as

208
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,600
the eye could see.

209
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,880
- Except...

210
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,880
- Rising into the sky

211
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,600
was a black

212
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,600
pillar of stone.

213
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,240
A tower so dark

214
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,840
it could swallow

215
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,840
the sun.

216
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,320
Arthur:<i> The dark tower.</i>

217
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,640
It's a place where

218
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,640
every young knight's

219
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,040
taught to dread,

220
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,040
and rightly so.

221
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,600
It's where many

222
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,600
have met their end.

223
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,160
I've never heard of it.

224
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,040
With good reason.

225
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,400
It's said that

226
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,400
the mere mention of it

227
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,960
can bring doom to

228
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,960
any of those who hear it.

229
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,040
Well,

230
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,960
let's not

231
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,960
mention it again.

232
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,480
I was having a dream

233
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,480
about eating a cheese

234
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,160
that tasted of apple pie.

235
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,960
<i>Anyone else</i>

236
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,960
<i>have that dream?</i>

237
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,240
You're all

238
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,240
missing out.

239
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
(Sighs)

240
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
Why would they both

241
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
have that dream?

242
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,000
Poison.

243
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,320
Must still be coursing

244
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,320
through their veins.

245
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,560
But the same dream?

246
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,480
Arthur, morgana

247
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,480
conjured those snakes.

248
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,000
Leon and percival

249
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,000
would be dead if that

250
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,000
was what she wanted.

251
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,320
So what are you saying?

252
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,320
She planted those visions

253
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,320
in their minds.

254
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,920
<i>It's a trap.</i>

255
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,080
She's luring you

256
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,080
to your doom.

257
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
At the tower.

258
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,080
That's where she's

259
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,080
taken Guinevere.

260
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,400
<i>(Screaming)</i>

261
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,200
<i>(Screams)</i>

262
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,600
I've decided to journey

263
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,600
to the dark tower.

264
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,040
<i>It's my belief that Guinevere's</i>

265
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,040
<i>been imprisoned there.</i>

266
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,440
I don't know what

267
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,440
horrors will be waiting,

268
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,040
so I'll travel alone.

269
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,200
No.

270
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,440
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,440
I've made my decision.

272
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,840
You can't stop me, Arthur.

273
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,000
She's my sister.

274
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,760
Nor me, Arthur.

275
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
She's our queen.

276
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,120
And our friend.

277
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,040
<i>She's a maiden</i>

278
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,040
<i>in a tower.</i>

279
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,560
Damsel in distress.

280
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,520
I was born for

281
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,520
this moment.

282
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,840
You can turn back, Merlin.

283
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,760
I made you a promise, remember?

284
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
Arthur:<i> The dark tower.</i>

285
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,840
How do we get to it?

286
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,160
Through the impenetrable forest.

287
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,040
- But it's...

288
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,040
- Impenetrable.

289
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,600
Exactly.

290
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,600
We can't possibly

291
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,600
get through there.

292
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,800
We must.

Blunt anyway.

Don't stop.

306
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,200
We've lost the path.

307
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,520
Then we'll keep

308
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,520
heading north.

309
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,400
How do we know

which way is north?

311
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,840
The Ivy.

something to eat.

out of the forest by now.

<i>How can that be?</i>

335
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,600

Eat. Here.

Food always makes

me feel better.

348

some chicken?

350
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,080
You must eat.

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,120
I know how lonely

359
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,120
you must be.

360
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,560
All by yourself

361
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,560
in that room.

362
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,440
At least you're

363
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,440
not shackled.

364
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,920
And there's daylight.

365
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,840
You can move.

366
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,840
You can see.

367
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,680
You expect me

368
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,680
to be grateful?

369
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,440
I too have suffered, Gwen.

370
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,000
I spent two years

371
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,000
living in darkness.

372
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,640
Spent two years

373
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,640
chained to a wall

374
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
at the bottom of a pit.

375
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,280
You did not know.

376
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,440
I would have sold my soul

377
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,440
for someone to show me

378
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,320
kindness such as this.

379
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,600
<i>If you want me</i>

380
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,600
<i>to take you back up there...</i>

381
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,000
<i>(Rustling)</i>

382
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,320
Welcome to my realm, emrys.

383
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,360
Who are you?

384
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,280
Why, I'm queen mab.

385
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,160
I am the spirit

386
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,160
of this place

387
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,000
and all the places

388
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,000
that bring despair

389
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,000
to men's hearts.

390
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,920
Few have ever

391
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,920
seen me, emrys.

392
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,240
You should count

393
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,240
yourself fortunate.

394
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,080
You...

395
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,280
Everything in in this forest.

396
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,680
It's bewildering.

397
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,280
The forest is but

398
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,280
one step on the journey.

399
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,080
How do we find

400
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,080
a way out?

401
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh, little one,

402
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,280
you should not

403
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,280
have to ask.

404
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,200
Left is right

405
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,200
and right is left,

406
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
and the way behind

407
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
is the way ahead.

408
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,560
It is simple.

409
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,440
Oh. Simple.

410
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,440
You have a mind's eye,

411
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,440
emrys.

412
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,800
You must learn

413
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,800
to trust in it.

414
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,400
Far greater challenges

415
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,400
lie ahead.

416
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,000
When we reach

417
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,000
the dark tower?

418
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,000
If.

419
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,920
What do you mean?

420
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,840
You must beware, emrys.

421
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,440
The tower is not

422
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,440
a real place.

423
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,200
It is the heart's rest.

424
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,000
<i>The mind's deepest fear.</i>

425
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,360
The stillness in

426
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,360
the hummingbird's eye.

427
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,680
Stop talking

428
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,680
in riddles.

429
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,240
Then I shall

430
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,240
talk in rhyme.

431
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,840
Heed my words

432
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,840
with due concern,

433
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,760
for one of you

434
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,760
will not return.

435
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,080
What do you mean?

436
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,480
(Chuckles)

437
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
Which one?

438
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,200
<i>We need to find the clearing</i>

439
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,600
where we saw

440
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,600
the dolorous plains.

441
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
Which way is that?

442
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,560
North.

443
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,320
Please. I know

444
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,320
I can get us there.

445
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,120
<i>I wouldn't do anything</i>

446
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,120
<i>to risk Gwen's life.</i>

447
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,040
I can get us

448
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,040
to the dark tower.

449
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,400
I am certain.

450
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,600
<i>I know what Gwen</i>

451
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,600
<i>means to you.</i>

452
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,200
To all of us.

453
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,960
We need to head north.

454
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,960
Which way is that,

455
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,960
Merlin?

456
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,440
That way.

457
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,760
No, it's...

458
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,000
Over there.

459
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,560
How on earth

460
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,560
would you know that?

461
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,320
Sense of smell.

462
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,960
When the wind is from the north,

463
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,960
you can smell the sea.

464
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,320
That's ridiculous.

465
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,720
Trust me just this once.

466
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,440
Arthur,

467
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,840
give him a chance.

468
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,120
<i>What choice do we have?</i>

469
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,000
Are you sure this is

470
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,000
the right way, Merlin?

471
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,000
Come on.

472
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,440
Merlin...

473
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,160
You're a genius.

474
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,200
Which way now?

475
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,000
How far do you

476
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,000
think it is?

477
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,800
At least we

478
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,800
can see where

479
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,800
we're going.

480
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,360
Let's not just stand

481
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,360

to dine with me.

488
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,000
Come, you must eat

00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,840
Your hands are cold.

492

There's a warm fire

493

going for you.

494
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,480
Anything you want,

00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,480
you can have.

496

Why are you doing this?

499

Because we're friends.

500
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,160
- We always were.

501
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,160

change your mind
